R: ggplot2
I added some explainations with ## ... ## based on my personal understanding of what we are doing on each step as well

Then convert Jupyter notebooks into standalone script.
Tools/libraries used:
Python: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn
R: ggplot2
To run each script, we run in JupyterLab terminal and specify the script as well as the dataset.
